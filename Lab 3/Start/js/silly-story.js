// VARIABLE DECLARATIONS

/* STEP 1: Declare and initialize variables
- customName for the name field
- randomize for the button
- story for the paragraph that outputs the final story
*/
/*
Weston Smith
Brad Buttineau
*/
var customName = document.getElementById('customName');
var randomize = document.querySelector('.randomize');
var story = document.querySelector('story');

/* STEP 3: Create the variable that contains the story string that will be modified - use var storyText to contain the following:
'It was 94 Fahrenheit outside, so :insertX: went for a walk. When they got to :insertY:, they stared in horror for a few moments, then :insertZ:. Bob saw the whole thing, but he was not surprised — :insertX: weighs 300 pounds, and it was a hot day.'
*/
var storyText = "It was 94 Fahrenheit outside, so :insertX: went for a walk. When they got to :insertY:, they stared in horror for a few moments, then :insertZ:. Bob saw the whole thing, but he was not surprised — :insertX: weighs 300 pounds, and it was a hot day.";


/* STEP 4: Create three arrays, insertX, insertY, and insertZ, assigning them the following array values respectively:
Donald Trump, Jackie Chan, Santa Claus
Area 51, Death Valley, Aruba
spontaneously combusted, rapidly sublimated, evaporated instantly
*/
var insertX = ['Donald Trump, Jackie Chan, Santa Claus'];
var insertY = ['Area 51, Death Valley, Aruba'];
var insertZ = ['spontaneously combusted, rapidly sublimated, evaporated instantly'];


// FUNCTIONS

/* STEP 2: have a look at the following function - if you call this function and pass it an array, it will return one of the elements of that array randomly */
function randomValueFromArray(array) {
	return array[Math.floor(Math.random() * array.length)];
}

/* STEP 6: Review the partially complete result() function below */
function result() {
	// STEP 7: Create a new variable called newStory and set it to the value of storyText - we don't want to overwrite the original story!
	var newStory = storyText;
	/* STEP 8: Use the randomValueFromArray() function to generate a value for each of three new variables - xItem, yItem, and zItem
	Call up the function and for each variable, pass it the array from which to grab a random string - for example if insertW was an array of strings, I would type:*/
	var xItem = randomValueFromArray(insertX);
	var yItem = randomValueFromArray(insertY);
	var wItem = randomValueFromArray(insertZ);


	/* STEP 9: Replace the three placeholders in the newStory string — :insertX:, :insertY:, and :insertZ: — with the strings stored in xItem, yItem, and zItem. Each time, be sure to update the variable newStory (with +=). You might need to do one of the above replacements twice! */
	var newStory = newStory.replace(':insertX:', xItem);
	var newStory = newStory.replace(':insertX:', xItem);
	var newStory = newStory.replace(':insertY:', yItem);
	var newStory = newStory.replace(':insertZ:', zItem);


	/* STEP 10: If the user has typed a name in the customName field, replace the name 'Bob' in the story with whatever they typed */
	if (customName.value != '') {
		var name = customName.value;
		newStory = newStory.replace('Bob', name);

	}
	/* STEP 11: If the metric radio button has been checked, we need to convert the temperature and mass numbers in the story */
	if (document.getElementById("metric").checked) {
		// STEP 11a: Create a variable called weight and convert the 300lbs to kgs (1lb = 0.453592kg)
		var weight = Math.round(300 * 0.0714286) + 'stone';

		// STEP 11b: Replace the string 300 pounds with the updated weight in kg
		var newStory = newStory.replace('300 pounds', weight);
		// STEP 12a: Create a variable called temp and convert °F to °C ... the formula for conversion is °C = (°F - 32) x 5/9
		var temperature = Math.round((94 - 32) * (5 / 9)) + 'centigrade';
		// STEP 12b: Replace the string '94 Fahrenheit' with the updated temperature in °C
		var newStory = newStory.replace('94 Fahrenheit', temperature);
	}
	/* STEP 13: Make the textContent property of the story variable (which references the paragraph) equal to newStory */

	// The following line makes the paragraph visible
	story.textContent = newStory;
	story.style.visibility = 'visible';
}

// EVENT LISTENERS
/* STEP 5: Add a click event listener to the randomize variable so that when the button it represents is clicked, the result() function is run. */
randomize.addEventListener('click', result);
